### Description

**Simplex AI Autonomy** is an AI management system designed to help zeus setup quick scenarios and not need to micro-manage AI. Once an AI group is assigned a certain role, the management system will make the AI fulfill that role, respond to enemy threats, and request assistance where needed.

For usage instructions, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/SceptreOfficial/Simplex-AI-Autonomy/wiki).

SAA is still under development, with many features yet to be implemented and bugs still to be found.
Feel free to contribute, submit issues, or suggest any new features via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SceptreOfficial/Simplex-AI-Autonomy/issues).
